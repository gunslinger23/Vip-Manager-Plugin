# tVip
Add Vips for a limited time and give those a flag of your choice

This Plugin allows you to add Vips on the fly to your Server, extend their Status or Remove them.
You can also lookup the details of Vips in a simple to use Menu.

The Plugin was designed for Large Communities that run a big amount of servers.
This is why it has a live MySQL Sync. This means no data is stored locally and everything is instantly synced to the database to allow a seamless workflow.

INSTALLATION:

- sm_vips - no flag - Shows all VIPs
